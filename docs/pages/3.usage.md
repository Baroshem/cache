This module exposes composables that are [auto-imported](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/composables) by Nuxt 3.

## `useAlgolia`

By calling this composable you have access to `algoliasearch` instance anywhere in your app

```vue
<script setup>
const algolia = useAlgolia()
</script>
```

For more details check out the official documentation of initializing algolia client [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/getting-started/instantiate-client-index/javascript/?client=javascript)

## `useSearch`

Use this composable to search the index by certain query and optional request options

```vue
<script setup>
const { result, search } = useSearch('test_index') // pass your index name as param

onMounted(async () => {
  await search({ query: 'Samsung' });
})
</script>
```

* `result` will contain a value of a search method. It is reactive computed property that will be populated when a search method will fulfill. This result will have a form described [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search/#response)
* `search` method is used to fetch the results by the index and populates `result` reactive property. This method requires a parameter `query` and accepts an optional parameter of `requestOptions` that you can check out [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search/#method-param-requestoptions)

For more details check out the official documentation of this method [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/methods/search/)

## `useSearchForFacetValues`

Use this composable to search using facet values like `category`, `phone`.

<alert type="info">

In order for this to work, you have to add facet attributes in your dashboard or via code. Read more about it [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/)

</alert>

```vue
<script setup>
const { result, search } = useSearchForFacetValues('test_index')

onMounted(async () => {
  const facet = { 
    name: 'category',
    query: 'phone'
   }
  await search({ facet })
})
</script>
```

* `result` will contain a value of a search method. It is reactive computed property that will be populated when a search method will fulfill. This result will have a form described [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search-for-facet-values/#response)
* `search` method is used to fetch the results by the certain facet value pairs like name and query, and populates `result` reactive property. This method requries a parameter for `facet` and accepts an optional parameter of `requestOptions` that you can check out [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search/#method-param-requestoptions)

For more details about using this search method check out the official documentation [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search-for-facet-values/)

## `useInitIndex`

Use this composable to initialize index you would like to search through. It accepts an index name as a parameter

```vue
<script setup>
const algoliaIndex = useInitIndex('test')

console.log(algoliaIndex.appId)
</script>
```

For more details about initializing index check out the official documentation [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/getting-started/instantiate-client-index/javascript/?client=javascript#initialize-an-index)
